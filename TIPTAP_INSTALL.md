# TipTap Installation Required

The npm install is having permission issues with the cache. Please run:

```bash
npm install @tiptap/react @tiptap/starter-kit @tiptap/extension-link @tiptap/extension-placeholder
```

If that fails with cache errors, try:
```bash
npm cache clean --force
npm install @tiptap/react @tiptap/starter-kit @tiptap/extension-link @tiptap/extension-placeholder
```

The RichTextEditor component has been created and is ready to use once the packages are installed.
